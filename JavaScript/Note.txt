# JavaScript:-
-JavaScript is a scripting and programming language, introduced to perform live-scripting or dynamic responsive on a web-page.
-Netscape Communications hired 'Brendan Eich' to develop a scripting language for their browser, Netscape Navigator. Eich created JavaScript in just 10 days.
-The language was first called "MOCHA", then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript—not because it's related to Java, but as a marketing decision to capitalize on Java’s popularity.
-JavaScript is used for building logics of a web page.
-JavaScript is a high level programming language, used in both client side as well as server side.
-Currently we are using JavaScript version 6 i.e ES6(Echma script 6), which is also called as vanilla JavaScript.
-Node JS is the run time environment of JavaScript.

## What is Scripting language ?
-A scripting language is a type of programming language used to automate tasks that executes line by line.
-For example - JavaScript, Python, PHP... etc.

# Variable Keywords in JS:-
-Variable keywords are used to declare a variable and to initialize a value to variables.
-There are three types of variable keywords:-
    -var
    -let
    -const 
## var:- If a variable is decalred using var keyword then we can re-declare and re-initialize the same variable.

## let:- If a variable is decalred using let keyword then we can re-initialize the same variable but we can't re-declare the same variable.

## const:- Const stands for constant variable.
-If a variable is decalred using const keyword then neither we re-declare nor re-initialize the same variable.

# Datatypes in JS:- 
-Datatypes are used to define which type of value we're storing on a variable.
- By using 'typeof' operator we can check the datatype of a varibale.
-There are two types of datatypes in JavaScript:-
    1.Primitive type
    2.Non-primitive type

1. Primitive-type:-
## Number type:- Represents all the possible types of numeric values; like - positive, negative, fraction, whole number, etc..

## boolean type:- It has only two types of values, i.e true and false.
-In JavaScript value of true is 1 and value of false is 0.

## null type:- Null means nothing, which is inherited from Object type. It stores nothing.

## undefined type:-When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, it is automatically initialized with undefined.

## Symbol type:– Used for creating unique values (Symbol("unique"))
-To create a Symbol type variable we need Symbol() operator.

## BigInt type:– Handles very large numbers (BigInt())
-To create a BigInt type varibale we need BigInt()m operator.
