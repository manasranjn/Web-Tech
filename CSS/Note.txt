iii) External CSS

## Inline CSS:-
-Adding styles for an individual element with the help of style attribute.
Syntax:-
<p style="color: red;">This is a paragraph</p>

## Internal CSS:- 
-Used to add styles for multiple elements or writing general styles with the help of style tag inside head tag.
-We need selectors to select or target the element which we need to change style.
Syntax:- 
<style>
    selector{
        css-property: value;
    }
</style>

## External CSS:- 
-Writing styles i a separate CSS file and then connecting it to the HTML document with the help of <link> tag.
-We use <link> tag inside the head tag to connect the external css.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="fileName.css">

# Selectors in CSS:- 
CSS selectors are used to select the HTML elements that we want to style.
1.Element Selector:-
-It is used to select the elements based on their tag name.
-Element selector selects all the element with the specific tag name in the entire HTML document.
e.g:- h1{
    font-size: 20px;
}

2. Class Selector:- 
-It selects the HTML elements based on the given class name.
-Class name can be provide by using "class" attribute.
-To selects the classs name in CSS we use dot(.) that acts as class selector.
e.g:- .className{
    color: red;
}

3. ID Selector:-
-It selects the HTML element based on the given ID name.
-ID name can be provide by using "id" attribute.
-ID name should be unique in an HTML document.

    height: 100px;
}

4. Universal Selector:- 
-It is used to select all the elements in the HTML document.
It is denoted as *

    background-color: black;
}

# Pseudo classes:-
-These are used to add styles to selectors but only when selectors meets certain condition.
-Pseudo class are written using colon(:)
e.g:- selector:active/hover

-It is the outer white space of an element.
-It follows the same syntax as padding.
