# CSS:-

## Inline CSS:-
-Adding styles for an individual element with the help of style attribute.
Syntax:-
<p style="color: red;">This is a paragraph</p>

## Internal CSS:- 
-Used to add styles for multiple elements or writing general styles with the help of style tag inside head tag.
-We need selectors to select or target the element which we need to change style.
Syntax:- 
<style>
    selector{
        css-property: value;
    }
</style>

## External CSS:-

    font-size: 20px;
}
